            <p class="mb-3">
                Walulel was born in 2017 out of the realisation that meaningful information about oneâ€™s neighbourhood
                and (existing or prospective) property was disparate at best and in most cases unavailable. This applied
                to renters and purchasers who had the means to access premium analysis in relation to any other asset
                they wished to purchase.</p>

            <p> With average property prices and rents soaring at the time, and with this being unlikely to change in
                the near future, Walulelâ€™s founders could see an ever-widening gulf between equity of information,
                meaning that urbanites in London, Accra, and in turn other city dwellers, would continue to part with
                money to live in properties and neighbourhoods based mainly on anecdotes, some partial information about
                historical price movements in the area, and distance to local infrastructure. We considered that this
                could at times yield positive outcomes for urbanites by chance, but on many occasions might lead to them
                not finding the best value neighbourhood for their particular wants and needs.
